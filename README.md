<h1>VolumeBoi</h1>
<h3>A set of volume knobs that control the volume levels of different applications in windows.</h3>
<p>Exists in two parts : Embedded Arduino Program & Lightweight PC Application </p> 

Currently  knobs are programmed to adjust the following programs
<ol>
<li>Current Active Applicaiton</li>
<li>Discord/Zoom</li>
<li>Firefox</li>
<li>Spotify</li>
</ol>

Hardware Used:
<ul>
<li>Arduino Nano (ATMEGA328P)</li>
<li>4x 1k Linear Potentiometers</li>
</ul>

Notes:
<ul>
<li>Only Tested with Windows 10</li>
<li>Ideally Logaraithmic Potentiometers should have been used for a more natural volume increase but this was implemented in software instead</li>
</ul>
